Es un proyecto econ\\xc3\\xb3mico en relaci\\xc3\\xb3n a lo que se emplea en combatir sus consecuencias (prevenci\\xc3\\xb3n y tratamiento de enfermedades respiratorias); el resultado se observa a corto plazo y es directamente proporcional  a la inversi\\xc3\\xb3n. Busco financiamiento en una empresa comprometida con el medio ambiente para hacer juntos de nuestro planeta, un mundo mejor. Esperando una pronta respuesta (o cualquier orientaci\\xc3\\xb3n para ayudarme en mi proyecto) y no haber sido una molestia, me despido muy atentamente. Gracias por su tiempo.

La gente, tal y como lo previ\\xc3\\xb3 el corrupto sistema pol\\xc3\\xadtico, se hart\\xc3\\xb3 del tema por m\\xc3\\xa1s delicado y acab\\xc3\\xb3 perdiendo inter\\xc3\\xa9s para dejar en manos de los corruptos alcaldes el destino del basurero al que no debi\\xc3\\xb3 de llegar ni un solo kilo de residuos. La supuesta cancelaci\\xc3\\xb3n del confinamiento que hoy qued\\xc3\\xb3 sin efecto es el primer paso para que el elcalde electo, Carlos Ortiz, quien tomar\\xc3\\xa1 posesi\\xc3\\xb3n en enero pr\\xc3\\xb3ximo, permita abiertamente que opere y la negra herencia del Chema Lozano, Rosal\\xc3\\xada   G\\xc3\\xb3mez y Eusebio Aguilar que apoyaron interesadamente la construcci\\xc3\\xb3n y sentenciaron a Zimap\\xc3\\xa1n eternamente tomar\\xc3\\xa1 forma para desgracia de la poblaci\\xc3\\xb3n.

Quiero comentarle de que tengo un proyecto para la eliminación del SMOG existente en las grandes ciudades invadidas por la contaminación ambiental causada por la combustión de los motores y/o las industrias. Es un proyecto económico en relación a lo que se emplea en combatir sus consecuencias (prevención y tratamiento de enfermedades respiratorias); el resultado se observa a corto plazo y es directamente proporcional  a la inversión. Busco financiamiento en una empresa comprometida con el medio ambiente para hacer juntos de nuestro planeta, un mundo mejor. Esperando una pronta respuesta (o cualquier orientación para ayudarme en mi proyecto) y no haber sido una molestia, me despido muy atentamente. Gracias por su tiempo. Un fuerte abrazo\n",

       "Para contribuir con la nada agradable distinción de estar entre los pueblos más contaminados del mundo, el miserable alcalde de Zimapán y sus secuaces en el cabildo, permiten hoy, nuevamente, una ridícula  reapertura del confinamiento cuando el mismo, no detuvo operaciones nunca como desde cuando fue abierto con el encubrimiento del Chema Lozano y Willy Trejo. La gente, tal y como lo previó el corrupto sistema político, se hartó del tema por más delicado y acabó perdiendo interés para dejar en manos de los corruptos alcaldes el destino del basurero al que no debió de llegar ni un solo kilo de residuos. La supuesta cancelación del confinamiento que hoy quedó sin efecto es el primer paso para que el elcalde electo, Carlos Ortiz, quien tomará posesión en enero próximo, permita abiertamente que opere y la negra herencia del Chema Lozano, Rosalía   Gómez y Eusebio Aguilar que apoyaron interesadamente la construcción y sentenciaron a Zimapán eternamente tomará forma para desgracia de la población. Los jales, la inmensa fosa séptica que es la presa Zimapán, la impune industria minera y la repugnante corrupción de politicastros en la presidencia municipal, gobierno del estado y aparato federal más la escasa conciencia y dejadez de la gente se combinaron para colocar a Zimapán entre los puntos más temibles del planeta por la contaminación. Para quienes todavía creemos posible subsanar nuestro medio ambiente contra todo pronóstico,habrá mucho por hacer y estamos sobre éso.\n",
